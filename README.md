# Chat-GPT-bypass-real
Chat GPT bypass made by Raiin.

To run it you just need to open your Terminal do `git clone https://github.com/skepptpvp/Chat-GPT-bypass-real/` 
than `cd Chat-GPT-bypass-real`, after that go to https://beta.openai.com/ and make a account, click on your profile than click on API keys.
Click on `Make a new API key`, after doing that copy the key and do `export CHATGPT_TOKEN=(your token)` (in Terminal ofc).
That's it, you should be able to run the script by doing `./chatgptBypass.sh` (if it doesn't work make sure do to `chmod a+x chatgptBypass.sh`)

(I made this for Linux so I wont provide support to any Windows users)
